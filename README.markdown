# model_maker

This is the very beginning of a project I'm working on to introspect a legacy database and create ActiveRecord model files from the results. For the first steps, I'm limiting this project to:

1. Only MySql
2. Start creating shell files then add:
     a. has_many and belongs_to relationships
     b. many_to_many relationships will assume a has_many :through => pattern at first
